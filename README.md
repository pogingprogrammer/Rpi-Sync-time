ROS TIME PUBLISHER AND TIME SUBSCRIBER FOR RPI AND DESKTOP/LAPTOP COMMS
I used this because i had a problem setting up NTP server in my RPi to sync time with my laptop for my thesis project. 

- This was very useful in my thesis project it made me able to use Hector Slam without using internet on my Pi to sync time with my laptop. It made my thesis project used in areas without internet and just needed to make my Pi and Laptop connected to one network(Router). 

Feel Free to use it if you need it.
